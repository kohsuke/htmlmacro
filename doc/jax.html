<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  JAX-* tagset defines a documentation template suitable for
  release notes of software products, such as JAXB, JAX-WS, etc.
  This document that you are seeing right now is generated by using this tag set.
</p>
<p>
  To use template, you need to set the following properties on
  <a href="antTask.html">the docgen task invocation</a>.
</p>
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <th>Property name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Required?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>javaNetProjectName</td>
    <td>
      If a project has the java.net project, the name of the java.net project. E.g., "jaxb"
    </td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SPEC_VERSION</td>
    <td>
      If a project has the related JCP spec, the version of it. E.g., "2.0"
    </td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IMPL_VERSION</td>
    <td>
      If a project has an implementation version to be listed in the doucment. E.g., "2.0.1"
    </td>
    <td>No, but you really should have one</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IMPL_VERSION_SUFFIX</td>
    <td>
      If a project has a suffix to add to the implementation version to be listed in the doucment. E.g., "fcs"
    </td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>
	First, copy <tt>tags/wts</tt> and <tt>tags/jax</tt> to somewhere in your project. Perhaps <tt>docs/tags/..</tt>. Also copy <tt>docgen.jar</tt> in your project. Then <a href="antTask.html">expand your build script</a>.

<h2>How do I write docs?</h2>
<p>
	JAX-* tagset overrides the &lt;head> and &lt;body> tags to inject necessary templates, so your source HTML should look like:
<pre class=code>
&lt;html>
&lt;head <b>caption="JAX* tag set"</b>>
  <b>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/default.css"/></b>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
  &lt;p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...
</pre>
<p>
	The caption attribute of the head tag specifies the title of the document. The HTML &lt;title> tag is generated by the templte based on this value. The banner and the navigation bar are also generated at the very top of the body.
<p>
	The nested stylesheet is a part of the template and is necessary to properly render navigation bars and other page elements. These stylehseet related resources should be copied from <tt>tags/wts/style</tt>.
<p>
	See <a href="jax.txt">the source HTML of this document</a> for more details.

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
<p>
	This tag set generates the navigation bar at the top, as you see. For this purpose, you need to write an XML file called <tt>toc.xml</tt> to describe the HTML structure. See <a href="toc.xml">the example</a> and hopefully the structure should be faily obvious.
